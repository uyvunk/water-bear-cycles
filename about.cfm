              <p class="bodytext">As the owner of WaterBear Cycles Trading Trading I been  an avid road and mountain cyclist since the early 90's and have been involved  in the retail cycling industry since 1995. I established WaterBear Cycles Trading in  Wilmington, Delaware in 2002 while running a small reputable repair shop. I have  shared my passion for the sport with many cycling enthusiasts and have played a  major role in keeping thousands of cyclists happily riding and racing over the  years. We run business with honesty, integrity and the highest standards  available in today's rapidly growing cycling market.<br>
                <br>
Attempting to find my niche in the cycling industry was a difficult task  considering I love all aspects of the market and most importantly all aspects  of the sport. We understand that it is not always easy to come up with the  funds to purchase the latest and most up to date bicycles and cycling  equipment. This is where WaterBear Cycles Trading Trading can assist. WaterBear Cycles  Trading is an online tool designed for bicycle owners and retailers to sell  previously owned bicycles for cash or on consignment. We also buy left over  dealer inventory and new product as well.</p>

                <br>
A WaterBear is a tiny microscopic living organisms that is found around the  world residing in many common areas such as our own back yards. The WaterBear  is the world's most resilient living organism. It can withstand the test of  time and natures harshest climates. One example is that it can be dried up for  over 500 years and come back to life with only a single drop of water. The  WaterBear stands as a symbol of strength and resilience for <strong>our </strong>company.</p></td>
